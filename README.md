## A demo

This is a demo to produce a time lapse of threatened antarctic/subantarctic species using occurrence data from [OBIS](iobis.org) retrieved using their R package [robis](https://github.com/iobis/robis), [IUCN redlist](http://www.iucnredlist.org/) classification and [gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) library.

Shown below is the `.gif` produced from the R notebook [here](./occurrence_time_lapse.Rmd).
